- 2026-08-07 — Rebuilt `index.html` as the full 4-tab app prototype — Android
  phone mockup at 360px with the bottom nav from the supplied screenshot
  (Health / Activity / Sleep / Me). Sleep and Activity recreated from the
  approved standalone prototypes (score rings, hypnogram, vitals line charts,
  goals, week rings, workouts, continuity pills, chart scrubbing, date +
  3-dot menus). Health and Me are first-pass layouts (flagged in comments —
  no spec yet). Added a control panel beside the phone that switches every
  data card between five states: default, loading, syncing, watch-not-worn
  and empty. Colors/fonts mirror js/tokens.js as CSS variables (flagged:
  inlined because file:// blocks module imports).

- 2026-07-19 — Initial skeleton created — set up folder structure, tokens.js
  with placeholder palette, and a minimal Sleep screen in index.html that reads
  all colors from tokens. Starting point for a solo prototyper.
