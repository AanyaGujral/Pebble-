# Session Handoff

**Read this first when you (or Claude) pick up work.** It says what shipped,
what decisions were made, and the exact next steps.

## Current status

- `index.html` is now the full app prototype: Android phone mockup (360px)
  with 4 tabs — Health, Activity, Sleep, Me — and the bottom nav recreated
  from the supplied screenshot.
- Sleep and Activity tabs are recreated from the approved standalone
  prototypes (in `Sleep Tab/` and the uploaded Activity file): score rings,
  hypnogram, overnight vitals charts, today's goals, goals-met week rings,
  workouts list, nap, sleep continuity. Line/bar charts support press-drag
  scrubbing (value + timestamp swap into the card header).
- A control panel sits beside the phone and switches every data card between
  five states: **default, loading, syncing, watch-not-worn, empty**.
- `js/tokens.js` holds the real brand palette (crimson→orchid ramps,
  neutrals, metric aliases, League Spartan numerals + Google Sans Flex text).

## Decisions made (all flagged in code comments too)

- Token values are mirrored into CSS custom properties inside `index.html`
  because ES-module imports don't work over `file://` (the double-click
  requirement wins). If `js/tokens.js` changes, re-copy the values.
- Health and Me tabs have no approved spec — they are first-pass layouts
  reusing hero/tile/list patterns from the approved screens.
- The Activity hero's photographic backdrop was replaced with token
  gradients to keep the file small and colors tokenised.
- The full-month calendar from the standalone prototypes was simplified to
  a 7-day date dropdown in this build.
- 3-dot menu entries (About / Goal setting / Share) are visual-only here;
  the full subpages exist in the standalone prototypes.

## Exact next steps

1. Metric detail pages (tap a card → full-screen metric history).
2. Workout details page for the Activity tab.
3. Port the About / Goal-setting subpages from the standalone prototypes.
4. Review Health and Me layouts with the owner and turn them into specs
   under `docs/`.

## Known limitations

- Google Sans Flex / League Spartan load from the Google Fonts CDN; offline
  the prototype falls back to system sans (layout still holds).
- Chart data is invented sample data shaped to match the numbers shown in
  the approved prototypes.
