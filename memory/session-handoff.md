# Session Handoff

> **2026-08-27 — read this first.** The homepage now lives as a standalone
> screen at `Home Tab/Home Tab.html`, pulled from the published "Pebble Home"
> artifact (the newer 4-tab build — note `index.html` at the root is still the
> OLDER Activity-focused prototype and does not contain the home tab, the
> three score rings, or the Health monitor at all). Three owner fixes are in:
> ring labels take the Workout Tab's "SCORE" overline token (now uppercase),
> health-monitor unit words take the KM/KCAL token (weight 600 → 500), and the
> Stress dot is now `metric.stress` = emerald-400, added to `tokens.json` and
> `js/tokens.js` — it had been a raw aqua placeholder that existed in neither.
> FLAG carried forward: emerald-400 is also `metric.distance`, so two signals
> share a hue; owner chose this knowingly.
>
> **Next step is the owner's call:** this file is the homepage only, meant to
> be merged back into the full prototype. Nothing has merged it yet. Decide
> whether `index.html` gets replaced by the artifact build (with this home
> screen dropped in) or whether the artifact stays the working source. See the
> 2026-08-27 changelog entry for exactly what was dropped from the artifact to
> isolate the screen, and for the two artifact defects fixed on the way (a
> stray `</style>` that was leaking ~75 lines of CSS onto the page as text,
> and a raw-hex `html` background).

> **2026-08-10 — read this first.** `index.html` is now the MERGED source of
> truth: it adopts the parallel session's build (metric details pages with a
> D/W/M/Y period switcher; control panel reduced to Default + No data and
> scoped to the Activity tab — Health/Sleep/Me tabs temporarily disabled in
> the tab bar) plus this session's StatTile feedback round (component-styled
> summary tiles, thousands formatting, one-line headers, DAY-11 best-day
> format, taller chart axis gap, no-data = headers + — + empty chart frames).
> The owner approved on 2026-08-10 and the branch is now PUSHED. The named
> snapshot lives in `Activity Tab/Workout Tab.html`; `index.html` stays the
> live working copy at the root. The background PNGs STILL have not arrived
> as files (three attempts, inline previews only), so the code-drawn
> stand-in scenes are what ship. Image slots are wired to
> `assets/backgrounds/activity-dusk.png` + `sleep-night.png` — dropping the
> real files in takes over automatically.

**Read this first when you (or Claude) pick up work.** It says what shipped,
what decisions were made, and the exact next steps.

## Current status

- `index.html` is now the full app prototype: Android phone mockup (360px)
  with 4 tabs — Health, Activity, Sleep, Me — and the bottom nav recreated
  from the supplied screenshot.
- Sleep and Activity tabs are recreated from the approved standalone
  prototypes (in `Sleep Tab/` and the uploaded Activity file): score rings,
  hypnogram, overnight vitals charts, today's goals, goals-met week rings,
  workouts list, nap, sleep continuity. Line/bar charts support press-drag
  scrubbing (value + timestamp swap into the card header).
- A control panel sits beside the phone and switches every data card between
  five states: **default, loading, syncing, watch-not-worn, empty**.
- `js/tokens.js` holds the real brand palette (crimson→orchid ramps,
  neutrals, metric aliases, League Spartan numerals + Google Sans Flex text).

## Decisions made (all flagged in code comments too)

- Token values are mirrored into CSS custom properties inside `index.html`
  because ES-module imports don't work over `file://` (the double-click
  requirement wins). If `js/tokens.js` changes, re-copy the values.
- Health and Me tabs have no approved spec — they are first-pass layouts
  reusing hero/tile/list patterns from the approved screens.
- The Activity hero's photographic backdrop was replaced with token
  gradients to keep the file small and colors tokenised.
- The full-month calendar from the standalone prototypes was simplified to
  a 7-day date dropdown in this build.
- 3-dot menu entries (About / Goal setting / Share) are visual-only here;
  the full subpages exist in the standalone prototypes.

## Exact next steps

1. Get the two background PNGs from the owner as file uploads and save them
   to `assets/backgrounds/activity-dusk.png` + `sleep-night.png` (slots are
   already wired; code-drawn stand-ins show until then).
2. Owner approval → push the pending local commits to
   `claude/pebble-app-tabs-prototype-jty6sh`.
3. Metric detail pages (tap a card → full-screen metric history).
4. Workout details page for the Activity tab.

## Done since first build (feedback round, 2026-08-07)

- Month-scroll history calendar modal (scroll up for earlier months) on all
  three data tabs; picking a day updates that tab's date label.
- About activity / About sleep read-only pages behind the 3-dot menus.
- Goal setting: activity (steps / distance / calories value sheet) and
  sleep (24 h bedtime dial, drag handles, 15-min snap, wake-up alarm toggle).
- Sleep continuity card expands to the "When you slept" 7-night timeline.
- All icons now Phosphor (path data embedded in index.html).
- Health tab: greeting "Good morning, Aanya", three nested rings
  (sleep / readiness / activity) + legend chips.
- Me tab rebuilt after the owner's settings screenshot: PBL Qore 2 device
  card (MAC, firmware, Unbind, status), working toggles, grouped rows —
  all colors/type from tokens.

## Known limitations

- Google Sans Flex / League Spartan load from the Google Fonts CDN; offline
  the prototype falls back to system sans (layout still holds).
- Chart data is invented sample data shaped to match the numbers shown in
  the approved prototypes.
